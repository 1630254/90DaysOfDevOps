## Basic Understanding
**DevOps**:  
Basic understanding of DevOps. DevOps is a culture and set of practices that bridge the gap between software development and IT operations. It encourages collaboration between these teams by using automation tools and processes. The main goal of DevOps is to reduce the time it takes to deliver software to the market (time-to-market) and to continuously improve the product. This is achieved through practices like continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD), and by using customer feedback to make rapid updates and improvements.

**Cloud Engineering**:  
Cloud computing is the delivery of IT resources—like servers, storage, databases, networking, and software—over the internet, instead of relying on physical hardware in a local data center. As an AWS Cloud Engineer, I see the cloud as a way to make infrastructure flexible, scalable, and cost-efficient. You pay only for what you use, and you can scale up or down instantly depending on demand. The cloud also enables automation, global availability, and faster innovation, because teams don’t have to worry about managing physical servers.
